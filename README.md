# AtliQ-Business-Insights-360
Power BI project analyzing AtliQ Hardware's sales, finance, marketing, and supply chain data.

## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware, a fast-growing company expanding globally, specializes in selling computers and accessories through three main channels: retailers, direct sales, and distributors.

Despite its growth, the company faced unexpected losses after opening a store in America. These setbacks were identified through surveys, intuition, and basic Excel analysis. With competitors boasting robust analytics teams, AtliQ Hardware recognizes the urgent need to develop its analytics capabilities to thrive in the industry.

The company has decided to implement Power BI for analytics to surpass competitors and enable data-driven decision-making. This project aims to give stakeholders insights into finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain, ensuring informed decisions at all levels.

I worked on this project by following the Codebasics Power BI Course,

## Datasets:

Before diving into analysis, understanding the datasets is crucial. The datasets consist of two tables:

**Dimension table:** Contains static data such as customer and product details.

**Fact table:** Stores transaction data.

### gdb041:
* dim_customer
* dim_market
* dim_product
* fact_forecast_monthly - Used to forecast customer demand, aiding in higher customer satisfaction and reducing warehouse storage costs.
* fact_sales_monthly - Similar to the fact_forecast_monthly table, but the last column represents the sold quantity instead of the forecasted value.

### gdb056:
* freight_cost
* gross_price
* manufacturing_cost
* Pre_invoice_deductions
* Post_invoice_deductions

### Importing Data and Data Modeling:

Data was imported from MySQL into Power BI, followed by data cleaning and transformation before modeling. But why is data modeling crucial for analysis?

A data analystâ€™s workflow typically consists of four key steps:

ðŸ”¹ Data Extraction ---> ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning ---> ðŸ”¹ Data Modeling ---> ðŸ”¹ Data Analysis

Skipping data modeling can negatively impact the final analysis. Proper modeling lays the foundation for reports, as all visuals rely on the underlying data model. Poor modeling can also reduce report performance.

In this project, the **Snowflake schema** data modeling method was used.
